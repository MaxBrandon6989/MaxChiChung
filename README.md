## About Me
I am a dedicated Information Systems (Digital Economy Technology) student at UTAR, currently in my second year. As an INTJ, I thrive on logical problem-solving, structured environments, and continuous self-improvement. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex IT infrastructure and business compliance.

Currently focused on: Enhancing my knowledge in IT Control & Audit and Cybersecurity.

Current Goal: Elevating my academic standing and refining my technical skill set to industry standards.

Learning Journey: Actively studying advanced Python for data analytics and exploring the ethical implications of AI in banking.

Personal Philosophy: "Progress may be steady, but consistency is the key to transformation." (Reflected in my 20kg weight loss journey and academic persistence).

[Loan Eligibility Prediction using Machine Learning with XAI]

The Problem: Traditional credit scoring models are often "black boxes," making it difficult for banks to explain rejection reasons to customers.
